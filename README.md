# Pomelo Pay Test

1. I used my react native boilerplate to initialize this project. You can check here: [react-native-boilerplate](https://github.com/huynextlevel/react-native-boilerplate).
2. Run `yarn` to install dependencies
3. Run `cd ios && pod install`

4. Start the packager with `yarn start`
5. Connect a mobile device to your development machine
6. Run the test application:
- On Android:
  - Run `react-native run-android` or Use Android Studio (Recommended)
- On iOS:
  - Open `pomelopayApp.xcworkspace` in Xcode
  - Hit `Run` after selecting the desired device
